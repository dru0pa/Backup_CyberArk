# Backup_CyberArk

Welcome to our script that automates the execution of CyberArk PAReplicate.exe and emails the log file PAReplicate.log, which has been zipped and password protected.
This script was developed with help from OpenAI.

This script is designed to make the process of running PAReplicate.exe and managing the log files as efficient and secure as possible.
The script will execute the PAReplicate.exe and create a log file named PAReplicate.log. This log file will be zipped and password protected for added security. 
Once the script has completed, an email will be sent to the specified recipient with the zipped, password-protected log file as an attachment.

Before running the script, please ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as Python and the required libraries.
You will also need to have access to the PAReplicate.exe file, the email credentials and the email address of the recipient to whom the log file will be sent.

The script is well commented and easy to understand, so it can be easily modified to suit your specific needs.

To run the script, simply navigate to the script directory in the command prompt and run the command: python PAReplicate.py

Thank you for using our script, and please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or need any assistance.
